  - Senior Engineer and Senior staff account for the title with the most employees retiring, 25,916 and 24,926 respectively.
  - The expected number of employees coming up for retirement is 72,458.
  - The number of expected retiring employees eligible for the mentorship program is 1,549.
  - Of the staff eligible as a mentor, Senior staff and Engineer are the titles with the highest number of eligible employees.


## Summary
The expected "silver tsunami" will require 72,458 roles to be filled as employees begin to hit retirement age. Of those reaching retirement age, 1,549 are eligible to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. The majority of those eligible employees hold a senior position title, 845 between Senior Engineer and Senior Staff. There will not be enough qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the future employees with 1 mentor for every 46 new hires. A pivot chart created from the mentorship-eligibility query breakdown the spread of retiring employees by title. This chart may provide useful insight into directing mentorship designations as the senior level position holds the highest amount of expected retiring employees.

The recommendation is to expand the retirement age for eligible employees to increase the number of mentors. The query to create the mentorship-eligibility table can be adjusted to look at additional years of retirement eligibility, expanding the mentorship pool to compensate for the high number of retiring employees.

By looking at employees with birth dates one year before 1965 the mentorship employee pool has a potential increase of 18,356 possibly retiring employees.
